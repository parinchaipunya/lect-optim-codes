    "In this notebook we consider a planning problem that covers $T$ periods of time.\n",
    "If there is a production in a given period $t \\in \\{1,\\dots,T\\}$, a fixed cost $c^{\\text{fixed}}_{t}$ is incurred regardless of the production amount.\n",
    "We assume that the production demand $d_{t}$ at a period $t$ is known, and it has to be met.\n",
    "However, we allow *overproduction* where the excess goods are stored for the demand of the later periods.\n",
    "This inflicts a *holding cost* $c^{\\text{holding}}_{t}$ per unit stored."
